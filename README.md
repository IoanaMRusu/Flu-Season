# Influenza Flu-Season
A fictional medical staffing agency provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals across the United States on an as-needed basis. This project's objective is to help the medical staffing agency prepare for influenza season, a time when in high demand.

# Motivation
The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary staff.

# Objective
Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.

# Scope 
The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.

# Visualization
A presentation of the results was made in Tableau and can be seen here: [Preparing for Influenza Season](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ioana.rusu2529/viz/InfluenzaSeasoninUSA__/InfluenzaSeason)
